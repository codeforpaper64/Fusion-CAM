# Fusion-CAM

## Overview
This is the official implementation of **Fusion-CAM**, introduced in the paper:

> **Fusion-CAM: Integrating Gradient and Region-Based Class Activation Maps for Robust Visual Explanations**

**Fusion-CAM** is an **Explainable AI (XAI)** approach that integrates and extends existing **Class Activation Mapping (CAM)** techniques to provide more stable and interpretable visual explanations for deep neural networks.  

The repository includes tools to **generate**, **visualize**, and **compare** multiple CAM methods, enabling direct side-by-side analysis of their interpretability and visual behavior on any input image and model architecture.

### Supported CAM Methods
- Grad-CAM  
- Grad-CAM++  
- XGrad-CAM  
- Score-CAM  
- Group-CAM  
- Union-CAM  
- **Fusion-CAM (proposed)**
